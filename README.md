# LezWatch.TV

LezWatch.TV catalogs and documents queer female, transgender, and non-binary characters, as well as their actors and shows from TV, web and streaming media. With that data, statistics are calculated on the state of international queer story representation. We provide easy and free access to finding the best shows with queer characters and stories in the genres fans want to see. We can help you keep up to date with the global happenings of queer representation on television.
