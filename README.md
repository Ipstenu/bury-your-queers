# Bury Your Queers

Being a queer female character on TV is more dangerous than being on the Titanic. Bury Your Queers by [LezWatchTV](https://lezwatchtv.com) allows you to show solidarity with fictional queer deaths.

The data can be displayed via a widget or a shortcode:

* the time since the last queer death and who it is
* an 'on this day' display of who died on that day in previous years

## Installation

The plugin is available from WordPress.org's plugin directory. The github repository is for development.
