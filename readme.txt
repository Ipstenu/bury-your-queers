Display the most recently killed queer female on TV, brought to you by LezWatchTV.

== Description ==

Being a queer female character on TV is more dangerous than being on the Titanic. Bury Your Queers, by [LezWatchTV](https://lezwatchtv.com), allows you to show solidarity with fictional queer deaths. By querying the data provided at [LezWatchTV](https://lezwatchtv.com), the plugin will display the latest queer female death or the names of those who died on the day in years past. 

The data can be displayed via a widget or a shortcode.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do you get your data? =

Data is pulled from [LezWatchTV](https://lezwatchtv.com).

= What information from my site is tracked? =

Nothing. We could get the domains of everyone who uses it, but that's about it. It's a read-only tool.

= What can I show? =

Two things!

* The time since the last queer death and who it is
* An 'on this day' display of who died on that day in previous years

= How accurate is the data? =

As accurate as possible. LezWatchTV is a hobby site after all.

= Is this US shows only? =

No! LezWatchTV records shows from the entire planet.

= Who owns LezWatchTV =

We do.

= You're missing some shows/characters =

Probably. The world is a big place. [Please drop us a line and let us know](https://lezwatchtv.com/suggestions-welcome/). We're always trying to make it better.

= Why only female queers? =

Because the site data is from LezWatchTV. If someone wants to make a similar site for male queers, we're happy to help them output their data so it can be used too.
