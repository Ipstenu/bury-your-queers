Display the most recently killed queer female on TV, brought to you by LezWatch TV.

== Description ==

Being a queer female character on TV is more dangerous than being on the Titanic. Bury Your Queers, by [LezWatch TV](https://lezwatchtv.com), allows you to show solidarity with fictional queer deaths. By querying the data provided at [LezWatch TV](https://lezwatchtv.com), the plugin will display the latest queer female death or the names of those who died on the day in years past.

The [terms of Use of LezWatch TV](https://lezwatchtv.com/tos/) allow free use of the data.

= Usage =

The data can be displayed via a widget or a shortcode.

**Widgets**

* **BYQ - Last Death** 
* **BYQ - On This Day**

**Shortcodes**

* `[lez-watch data="last-death"]`
* `[lez-watch data="on-this-day"]`
* `[lez-watch data="on-this-day" date-format="MM-DD"]`

If no date is passed to 'On This Day' it will default to today.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do you get your data? =

Data is pulled from [LezWatch TV](https://lezwatchtv.com).

= What information from my site is tracked? =

Nothing. We could get the domains of everyone who uses it, but that's about it. It's a read-only tool.

= What can I show? =

Two things!

* The time since the last queer death and who it is
* An 'on this day' display of who died on that day in previous years

= How accurate is the data? =

As accurate as possible. LezWatch TV is a hobby site.

= Is this US shows only? =

No! LezWatch TV records shows from the entire planet.

= Who owns LezWatch TV =

[We do](https://lezwatchtv.com/about/).

= You're missing some shows/characters =

We know. The world is a big place. [Please drop us a line and let us know](https://lezwatchtv.com/suggestions-welcome/). We're always trying to make it better.

= Why only female queers? =

Because the site data is from LezWatch TV. If someone wants to make a similar site for male queers, we're happy to help them output their data so it can be used too.
