Display the most recently killed queer female on TV, brought to you by LezWatchTV.

== Description ==

Being a queer female character on TV is more dangerous than being on the Titanic. Bury Your Queers by [LezWatchTV](https://lezwatchtv.com) allows you to have a widget displaying the time since the last queer death, with a link back to who died.

In the future, the plan is to include an 'On this Day' widget that lists any characters who died on the same day in previous years.
